// UPDATE: This is a special user_methods file from Odie to be used in the new TOV solver. This is the real customizable piece of the program, and runs in conjunction with Odie. Input your necessary parameters and evaluations, and it will run as necessary. It even has support to run with different types of equations of state: Simple Polytrope, Piecewise Polytrope, and tabulated EOS (which utilizes the GRHayL library).
// TODO: Edit this update description when the program is completed and allows for user choice in EOS
// TODO: The goal is that the user will never have to touch this file, and that all adjustments can be made in the driver file.
